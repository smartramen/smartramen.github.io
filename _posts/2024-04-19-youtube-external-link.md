As part of the First LEGO League Masterpiece season, Team 21544, Smart Ramen, created a new innovation - Smart Keys ðŸŽ¹. An assistive device, Smart Keys aim to reduce barriers to piano learning for a broad group of learners by incorporating 4 elements: colour, texture, braille, and note letter. Portable and lightweight, Smart Keys are designed to be reusable across different piano keyboards and have been designed with both teachers and learners in mind. With their innovation, Smart Ramen aims to bring the joys and benefits of music playing to people of all ages, regardless of ability, financial access, and previous musical background.
