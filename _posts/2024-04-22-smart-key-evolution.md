Version 5: Changed colour scheme from rainbow to current version based on Ms. Seun's input regarding standardized music colours. Changed name from "Rainbow Keys" to "Smart Keys".​

Version 6: Made "Smart Keys Slim". Reduced the thickness of the keys by 50% to save material and keep a lower profile for better ergonomics. Also tried another iteration in which the key profile was further reduced, but it presented problems in the printing process.​

Version 7 (Current): Based on feedback from experienced players, we made all edges rounded for a smoother user experience and easier transition to regular piano keys.​

Version 8: Changed "A" to purple to make Smart Keys compatible with Chrome Music Lab. ​
Used coloured filament for durability. Paint wore off quickly.​
